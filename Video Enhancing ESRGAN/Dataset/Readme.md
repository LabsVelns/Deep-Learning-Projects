## Video Enhancement using ESRGAN Dataset

This dataset contains a collection of videos that can be used to train and test video enhancement models. The videos are divided into two categories:

* **Training set:** This set contains several videos that can be used to train video enhancement models.
* **Test set:** This set contains many videos that can be used to test video enhancement models.

The videos in this dataset are of varying quality, and they include a variety of scenes, such as indoor and outdoor scenes, daytime and nighttime scenes, and scenes with different levels of noise. This dataset is ideal for training and testing video enhancement models that can improve the quality of videos.

## How to use this dataset

To use this dataset, you can download it from the Kaggle website. Once you have downloaded the dataset, you can unzip it and use the videos to train and test your video enhancement models.
